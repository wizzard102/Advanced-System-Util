this batch and powershell scripts were created to make an admins life a little easier for windows repair and lan administration

the batch file when ran will automatically elevate to administrator when ran
the powershell scripts will temporarly give policy rights for the duration of the script that is running

some of the powershell scripts are not created and maintained by me but are included within the script to make it easier for some operations.

this script is use at your own risk

the script can be modified or edited or added to by the end user enjoy!
